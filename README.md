# Manifold Ansible Demo

This repo houses code used in the [Manifold Ansible Integration blog
post](link-tbd). Itâ€™s set up to provision a simple Python application which
pushes logs to LogDNA.  Credentials necessary to authenticate with LogDNA are
fetched from Manifold using the [Ansible Manifold Lookup
plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/lookup/manifold.html).
